    "In collaboration with a UBC Computer Science research group, this project explores behavioral patterns of players on a Minecraft research server. The server records each player’s activity to understand player engagement, data contribution, and predict demand. Accurately predicting these factors helps the research team allocate server resources, target recruitment strategies, and improve player experience.\n",

    "## Data Analysis \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is this method appropriate?\n",
    "The k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) classification method is appropriate because the goal of the project is to predict whether a player subscribes to a game-related newsletter—a binary classification task. k-NN is a simple, flexible, and non-parametric model that does not assume any particular distribution of the input features. It works well with categorical variables (after they are properly encoded), making it suitable for our use of gender and experience. Furthermore, k-NN is useful for detecting local structure in the data, which is important for understanding how player traits might relate to subscription behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Which assumptions are required, if any, to apply the method selected?\n",
    "Although k-NN is non-parametric and does not assume linearity or normality, it still relies on a few practical assumptions. The most important assumption is that the features used to compute distances are meaningful and on comparable scales. In our case, since gender and experience are categorical, we used one-hot encoding to convert them into numeric dummy variables. Another assumption is that similar players will have similar outcomes, which is implicit in how k-NN makes predictions based on nearest neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are the potential limitations or weaknesses of the method selected?\n",
    "One major limitation of k-NN is that it can be sensitive to irrelevant or uninformative features. Since it relies on distance measures, including too many predictors or having poorly scaled variables can degrade performance. Additionally, k-NN can become computationally expensive as the dataset grows, though this is not a problem in our relatively small dataset. Another key limitation is that k-NN does not produce interpretable coefficients like logistic regression does, which makes it less suitable if we want to understand the exact effect of each predictor.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How did you compare and select the model?\n",
    "We selected k-NN classification as a simple and intuitive baseline model for our binary outcome. It serves as a good alternative to logistic regression when we want to explore whether prediction can be made using proximity-based similarity. We used a default of 5 neighbors (k = 5), which is a commonly recommended starting point. Although we did not tune k in this project, we could use cross-validation in future work to find the optimal value. This model allows us to test whether gender and experience level alone contain enough information to predict subscription behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  How are you going to process the data to apply the model?\n",
    "To prepare the data for k-NN classification, we first filtered the dataset to include only players with either \"Beginner\" or \"Pro\" experience levels. We also simplified the gender variable into three categories: Male, Female, and Other. Because k-NN requires numeric input, we applied one-hot encoding using step_dummy() to convert the categorical variables into binary indicator columns. We split the data into training and testing sets using initial_split() with a 70/30 proportion and stratified by the subscribe variable to preserve the class balance. The k-NN model was then trained on the training data, and predictions were evaluated using the test data.\n"

    "## Discussion\n",
    "In this project, we used a k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) classification model to predict whether a player subscribed to a game-related newsletter based on their gender and experience level. After filtering the data to include only “Beginner” and “Pro” players, and simplifying the gender variable, we trained a model using one-hot encoded predictors. The results showed moderate predictive accuracy, indicating that gender and experience do carry some information about a player's likelihood of subscribing, but are not highly strong predictors on their own.\n",
    "\n",
    "This result was somewhat expected. We anticipated that more experienced players might be more engaged and therefore more likely to subscribe, and that gender might play a minor role in shaping engagement behavior. However, the overall performance of the model suggests that these two variables alone are not sufficient to make highly accurate predictions, which aligns with the idea that player engagement is likely influenced by a wider range of behavioral and personal factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings have practical implications for how recruitment and communication strategies could be designed. If certain gender-experience combinations are more or less likely to subscribe, outreach materials can be better tailored. However, care should be taken not to overgeneralize based on limited predictors, especially when the model’s predictive power is only moderate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Future work could expand this analysis by including additional variables such as play time, session frequency, or interaction with the server. These behavioral metrics might provide more nuanced insight into who is likely to subscribe. It would also be valuable to explore other classification models or apply cross-validation to tune k and improve performance."
