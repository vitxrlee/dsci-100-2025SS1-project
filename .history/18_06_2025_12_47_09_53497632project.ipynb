    "\n",
    "In collaboration with a UBC Computer Science research group, this project explores behavioral patterns of players on a Minecraft research server. The server records each player’s activity to understand player engagement, data contribution, and predict demand. Accurately predicting these factors helps the research team allocate server resources, target recruitment strategies, and improve player experience.\n",

    "**Question 1:**  Can a player's gender predict their likelihood of subscribing to a game-related newsletter, and does this relationship differ between novice (\"Beginner\") and experienced (\"Pro\") players?\n",

    "## Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "The KNN model demonstrated that behavioral metrics such as played hours, session frequency, and experience level are useful predictors of whether a player subscribes to the newsletter. Players with longer play times and more frequent sessions showed a higher likelihood of subscribing.\n",
    "\n",
    "This aligns with expectations: more engaged users are more likely to seek updates and involvement with the game community. This analysis can guide the research team in targeting engaged users for promotional content and community building.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some limitations include:\n",
    "\n",
    "No session-level interaction or action data\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumes static behavior over time\n",
    "\n",
    "Uses basic features without engineered game event categories\n",
    "\n",
    "Future work should explore logistic regression and decision trees to assess interpretability and feature impact. Social activity (e.g., simultaneous play) could also offer predictive power."
